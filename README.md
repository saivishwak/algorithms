# Data Structures & AlgorithmsAlgorithms

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to implement common data structures and algorithms in C and other languages. Main focus will be in C to understand every detail.

# Contributing

This repository is contribution friendly :smiley:. If you'd like to add or improve an algorithm, your contribution is welcome!

# Running

This project supports multiple languages hence each language folder has README which has the instructions for running.
